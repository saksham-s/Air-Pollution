Precog Task A <br>
<br>
In this task I have analysed tweets on two topics namely Air Pollution in Delhi and Mumbai rains.<br>
<br>
Highcharts, D3.js and Google Maps API have been used to create the visualisations and make them interactive.<br>
<br>
The requirements for the the python script can be found in requirements.txt.<br>
<br>
The Flask application has been hosted on AWS and can be accessed from this link : http://ec2-13-115-54-217.ap-northeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com/ <br>
<br>
In order to run the code on your system follow these steps:
<br>
1.Setup MongoDB and use `mongorestore` to load the database into your local mongodb.<br>
2.Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all requirements.<br>
3.Run `python analysis.py` to run the webapp on localhost<br>
4.Access it on localhost at `127.0.0.1:5000`
